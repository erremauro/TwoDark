# TwoDark

Atom's OneDark-UI inspired theme for [Sublime Text][3].

## Why?

Even if other OneDark inspired theme for Sublime Text exists, 
I felt that they were all missing– for their own reasons –some of the details that I liked from the original. That's why I decided to roll the version that I wanted to use.

I hope you enjoy it.

## But, Is It Beautiful?

IDK, I'm just a README. [See][1] for yourself:
