In life I took many forms and seen many places.

Now I've traveled through time and space just to meet **you** at the perfect time, in the perfect place. I'm install.txt

How to Activate
===============

To activate the UI Theme and Color Scheme, modify you user preferences by selecting: `Sublime Text` -> Preferences -> Settings - User

{
  "theme": "TwoDark.sublime-theme",
  "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - TwoDark/TwoDark.tmTheme",
}

Restart Sublime Text after activating the theme.

Extra Icons
-----------

TwoDark ships with beautiful alternative icons for Sublime Text.

The original icons were designed by [Jannik Siebert](https://dribbble.com/shots/1827862-Yosemite-Sublime-Text-Icon) for the Spacegray theme. I've just updated the icon color scheme to match it with the UI.

Extra icons can be found in the `extra` folder inside the theme package. To view the content of the package select `Sublime Text` -> Preferences -> Browse Packages... and open `Theme - TwoDark`. If the goblin didn't touch anything, you should find your `extra` folder in there.

## Change OS X icon

Open your preferred `*.icns` icon. Select `File` -> Get Info
From the newly opened window, selected the icon in the upper left and press CMD + C to copy. 

Go to your Applications folder, select Sublime Text and then `File` -> Get Info. Select the Sublime Text icon in the upper left and press CMD + V to paste the icon.

## Change Windows icon

To change the Shortcut icon on Windows, Select the Sublime Text shortcut, right click and select "Properties".

Go to the `Shortcut` tab and click the `Change Icon...` button at the bottom.

Click `Browse...` and select your preferred `.ico` icons.
